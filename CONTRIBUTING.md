# Welcome to Axelor Utils contribution guide.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow of the Axelor Utils module.

**Two ways of contribution is possible.**

## By opening a proposal ticket

At any time and in any context, if you have an idea of a generic tool, you are very encouraged to open a proposal ticket on the [Axelor Utils redmine project](https://redmine.axelor.com/projects/axelor-utils) with a detailed description of the tool's utility and a context of usage.

If you don't have access to this redmine project, please ask **Lawrence Deneiple** _(l.deneiple@axelor.com)_ or **Cedric Guerrier** _(c.guerrier@axelor.com)_ to be added.

## By submitting a merge request

For any reason or origin, if a generic tool is written, then the developer who wrote it is encouraged to submit it to Axelor Utils via a MR on this gitlab repository.

Please note that writing tests for your submitted tool as well as writing correct and complete Javadocs are strictly mandatory. Your merge request will not be accepted if these requirements are not fulfilled.

Following the submission of your tool, you are free to create yourself a ticket on the project at the origin of the creation of your tool to remind you to use the accepted tool when it will be merged and available to use.
