title: Fix indirect references cleanup logic in UtilsRestService
type: fix

description: |
  Fix the processedModels cleanup logic in addReferences method to properly handle
  indirect references. The previous condition was too restrictive, causing issues
  with reference classification in menu navigation.

  This resolves the issue where indirect references were not properly cleaned up
  from the ThreadLocal processedModels set, leading to incorrect reference
  classification in subsequent calls.
