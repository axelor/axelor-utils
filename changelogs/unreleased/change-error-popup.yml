title: Lighten messages displayed in error popups through `ExceptionHelper`
type: change
description: |
  When the methods in the class `ExceptionHelper` was called with an `ActionResponse` parameter, the message to display 
  to the user in the UI was built from:
  * the prefix *"An error occurred with the following message :"*
  * the exception message itself
  
  However, the prefix didn't provide any additional value, as the title of the popup was already "Error". Removing it 
  will allow users to identify faster the real errors.
