title: Fix email validation regex to accept dashes in intermediate domain segments
type: fix
description: |
  The email validation regex in `EmailHelper` was rejecting valid email addresses
  containing dashes in intermediate domain segments (e.g., user@hdf.my-company.fr).

  Refactored `EmailHelper` with best practices:
  - Made class final with private constructor (utility class pattern)
  - Decomposed regex into named, documented constants for maintainability
  - Used possessive quantifiers to prevent catastrophic backtracking
  - Added Javadoc documentation
