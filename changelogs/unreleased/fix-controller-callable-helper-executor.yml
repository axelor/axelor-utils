title: Replace ControllerCallableHelper's ForkJoinPool with a single thread executor service
type: fix
description: |
  ForkJoinPool.commonPool() used by ControllerCallableHelper is statically declared. Therefore,
  the full application classloader is not used inside ForkJoinPool's threads.
  This caused issues with some external dependencies like resteasy.
